# 🥔🥬 Potato Leaf Disease Detection  

## 🌟 Overview  
This project is a deep learning-based system for detecting potato leaf diseases, specifically Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves. The model is deployed using **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly web interface for real-time disease classification.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Upload a potato leaf image for disease analysis  
✅ Instant classification into **Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight**  
✅ Confidence score for each prediction  
✅ Web-based interface powered by **Streamlit**  
✅ Lightweight **TFLite** model for efficient inference  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (for backend and model integration)  
- **TensorFlow Lite** (for optimized model inference)  
- **Streamlit** (for web-based UI)  
- **NumPy & PIL** (for image processing)  

## 🚀 Installation  

1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
cd Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection
```
  
2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ **Run the Application**  
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📁 Dataset  
The dataset consists of potato leaf images classified into three categories:  
- **Healthy**  
- **Early Blight**  
- **Late Blight**  

The dataset is preprocessed using resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.

## 📖 Model Details  
- **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- **Training Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Optimization:** Trained and converted to **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** for efficient mobile & web deployment  

## 📊 Results  
The trained model achieves high accuracy in detecting potato leaf diseases, making it a reliable tool for farmers and researchers.
